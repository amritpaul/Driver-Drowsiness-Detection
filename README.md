# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to prevent car accidents and indicate emergency situations using electronic components and security mechanisms.

The project has a wide range of applications in safety of passengers for man-driven vehicles at a public and private scale and also the design can not only be integrated in new cars but also in old cars as well as it is just an add on to mechanism to the cars main battery supply.

Although progress has been made by usage of glasses and implemented but in this project we plan to integrate a new design fabricated within car in order to reduce the hassle of wearing an extra eyewear.
